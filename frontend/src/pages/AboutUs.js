            CozyQuarter is a website dedicated to enabling RPI students and alumni
            to view and share feedback about on-campus dorms. It offers a comprehensive
            perspective on on-campus housing options for all students, especially freshmen,
            aiming to bridge the gap left by fragmented sources like Reddit discussions.
            </p>
            <p>CozyQuarter is being developed as a project for Software Design & Documentation.</p>
